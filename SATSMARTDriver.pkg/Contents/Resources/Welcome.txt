This is a kernel driver for Mac OS X external USB or FireWire drives.
It extends the standard driver functionality by providing access to drive
SMART data. The interface to SMART data is same as with ATA family
driver, so many existing applications should work. The driver requires
a SAT (SCSI ATA Translation) capable external drive enclosure.

The driver consists of a kernel extension and a user client interface
library.

Unmount all external drives. Reconnect the drives after installation.
Check the disk SMART status after installation using DiskUtility.

To uninstall remove driver and plugin in a Terminal:
    sudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/SATSMARTDriver.kext
    sudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/SATSMARTLib.plugin
