OS X SAT SMART Driver
#####################

This is a kernel driver for Mac OS X external USB or FireWire drives.
It extends the standard driver behaviour by providing access to drive
SMART data. The interface to SMART data is same as with ATA family
driver, so most existing applications should work. The driver requires
a SAT (SCSI ATA Translation) capable external drive enclosure.

The driver consists of a kernel extension and a user client interface
library.

The code is mostly derived from opensource.apple.com, so that license
should apply.

To try out: 

 * Compile all targets using XCode

 * IMPORTANT: Unmount all existing external drives. The driver will
   create duplicates of the drives and having the drive mounted twice
   will POSITIVELY CORRUPT the file system.

 * Load the kernel extension. Open a terminal.
    sudo tail -f /private/var/log/kernel.log &
    cd SATSMARTDriver/build/Debug/
    sudo cp -R IOSATDriver.kext /tmp
    sudo kextutil -t /tmp/IOSATDriver.kext

 * The external drives should mount automatically. Check them briefly
   and unmount them.

 * Test
    ./smart_status

    ./smart_sample

 * Check DiskUtility. The disk should show as "SMART capable: verified"

 * Unload the driver and copy it to system permanently
    sudo kextunload /tmp/IOSATDriver.kext
    sudo kextload /tmp/IOSATDriver.kext
